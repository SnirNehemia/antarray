### The Core Idea: An Iterative "Guess and Correct" Solver

We are solving a difficult **inverse problem**: we know the desired output (an ideal radiation pattern) and we need to find the complex input (the corrective weights) for a real-world, distorted system.

Instead of trying to solve this in one shot, we treat it as a **guided search**. We will use a modern AI technique, **Physics-Guided Diffusion**, which can be understood as an iterative "Guess and Correct" process.

The strategy is broken into two distinct phases:

### Phase 1: Training - Teaching an AI to Make Smart Guesses

**Goal:** Train a `DenoisingUNet` model to understand the fundamental structure of a solution. We don't teach it to solve the problem directly. We teach it to recognize and create plausible-looking sets of antenna weights.

**The Process (End-to-End Physics-Informed Training):**

1.  **Generate a Scenario:** Start with a simple, ideal case: calculate the `analytical_weights` for a random steering angle and the corresponding ideal `target_pattern`.
2.  **Add Noise:** Take the simple `analytical_weights` and add a random amount of noise to them. This creates our `noised_weights`.
3.  **The Model's Task:** Feed the `noised_weights` into the `DenoisingUNet`. The model's job is to predict a set of "clean" `corrective_weights`.
4.  **The Physics-Based Loss:** This is the crucial step. We **do not** compare the model's output to the original `analytical_weights`. Instead:
    *   We take the model's predicted `corrective_weights`.
    *   We plug them into our **real-world physics simulator** (`synthesize_embedded_pattern`).
    *   The loss is the difference between the resulting *simulated pattern* and our *desired target_pattern*.

**The Outcome:** The gradient from this loss forces the UNet to learn a very complex task. It learns to output weights that are **intentionally different** from the simple `analytical_weights` in a very specific way that perfectly counteracts the distortion of the embedded system. It learns the **inverse transformation function**.

### Phase 2: Solving - Using the AI and Physics to Find the Answer

**Goal:** Given a new, unseen `target_pattern`, use our trained AI as a "smart guide" to find the optimal corrective weights.

**The "Guess and Correct" Loop:**

1.  **Start with Noise:** Begin with a grid of pure random noise (`weights_T`). This is our initial, completely wrong guess.
2.  **Iterate:** Loop for a set number of steps (e.g., 200), progressively removing noise. In each step:
    *   **The "Smart Guess":** The trained `DenoisingUNet` looks at the current noisy weights and the target pattern, and proposes its best guess for the final, clean solution (`weights_0_pred`).
    *   **The "Physics Correction":**
        *   We run this guess through our `synthesize_embedded_pattern` simulator to see what pattern it would *actually* produce.
        *   We calculate the error between this simulated pattern and our target.
        *   We compute the **gradient** of this error with respect to the guessed weights. This gradient tells us, "To get closer to the target, you should slightly change your weight guess in this specific direction."
    *   **The "Guided Step":** We "nudge" the AI's guess using the physics gradient to get a new, improved guess (`weights_0_guided`). We then perform a formal diffusion step using this guided prediction to get a slightly cleaner set of weights for the next iteration.

**The Final Result:** After all the steps, the noise is gone. We are left with a single, high-quality set of `corrective_weights` that has been shaped by both the AI's general knowledge of good solutions and the hard, undeniable constraints of the physics simulation.
